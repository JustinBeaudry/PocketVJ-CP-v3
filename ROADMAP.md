## Roadmap
**********
### Priority:
- add ip range changer script, to switch between 192.168.2.* and 10.0.0.*

### Video: <br />
- check if on 24/7 sync installations files in /var/log/ or /tmp/ or /var/tmp/ grow and cause a sd overfill <br />
- check if really large videos play or if line 84 in  /usr/bin/omxplayer-sync
must be set to 15 <br />
- fade in/out for movies <br />
- play movies and images after each other <br />
- sync with USB alsa audio does not work, fix it! (is this needed in any way?)<br />
- jump to next file button <br />
– check this: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=199775&sid=dd74ed7acb6a1eaa3f21ec4753fed07

### Streaming: <br />
- advanced HTML5 contents (maybe insta & twitter feeds)<br />
- Remove NDI since NewTek discountinued ARM support<br />

### Autostart
- Autostart to Processing in fullscreen (still not sure how to execute command, any help from a processing pro?) <br />
- Autostart to sound analyzer (cava)  <br />

### Others:<br />

- Integrate remote webcam control  <br />
- move softedge file location to another place<br />
- function to show CPU usage (top is loded, just need to implement in CP now)<br />
- if this still causes trouble:  [terminal square blink](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3268/how-to-disable-local-terminal-showing-through-when-playing-video)

### Tutorials (Pocketvj.com/Vimeo): <br />

- New video which features the product and its functions<br />
