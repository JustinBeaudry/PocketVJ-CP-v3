## Roadmap
**********
### Important:<br />
- midi support for usb midi devices and mapping to CP (could be solved with puredata?, anyone can help?).<br />

### Video: <br />
- fade in/out for movies <br />
- play movies and images after each other <br />
- sync with USB alsa audio does not work, fix it! (is this needed in any way?)<br />
- jump to next file button <br />
- Slow motion function (1 Increase Speed 2 Decrease Speed) (dbus control no ready yet, waiting for new omxplayer version https://github.com/popcornmix/omxplayer)<br />
- Master Slave auto-detection<br />
- Audio reactive effects, like RGB change to beat, pulsating brightness, some efx similar to camera effects<br />

### Streaming: <br />
- Remove NDI since NewTek discountinued ARM support.<br />
- add TCPSyphon parts for video wall: https://github.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-v3/issues/5#issuecomment-452022353<br />
- Update Tcpsyphon (https://github.com/z37soft/INetSyphon_RaspberryPi_SDK) to newest version.<br />
- uv4l (https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/tutorials/desktop-streaming/)<br />

### Image: <br />
- slideshow with ken burns effect (maybe with QT: https://gist.github.com/nbergont/8963892, or openFramworks ofImage) <br />
- make a new slideshow function based on webbrowser so we could use transition effects <br />

### Mapper: <br />
- Build a completely new version of Mapper with more performance, remote controllable, syncable, edge blending. Prototype availabe on my github https://github.com/magdesign/MAGmapper. <br />
- Find a way to make the B101 CSI HDMI brige working again in ofxMapperCam. <br />

### Filebrowser: <br />
- Simplified filebrowser to upload files with drag'n'drop (dropzone.js, but how to configure server?) <br />

- move softedge file location to another place<br />
- Add OLA DMX trigger scripts to control PVJ with DMX commands<br />
- Add OLA DMX recorder script and DMX playback script to record and playback DMX commands <br />
