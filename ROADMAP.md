## Roadmap
**********

### Video: <br />
- check if really large videos play or if line 84 in  /usr/bin/omxplayer-sync
must be set to 15 <br />
- fade in/out for movies <br />
- play movies and images after each other <br />
- sync with USB alsa audio does not work, fix it! (is this needed in any way?)<br />
- jump to next file button <br />
- Slow motion function (1 Increase Speed 2 Decrease Speed) (dbus control no ready yet, waiting for new omxplayer version https://github.com/popcornmix/omxplayer)<br />
- Master Slave auto-detection<br />
- Audio reactive effects, like RGB change to beat, pulsating brightness, some efx similar to camera effects<br />

### Streaming: <br />
- advanced HTML5 contents (maybe insta & twitter feeds)<br />
- Remove NDI since NewTek discountinued ARM support<br />

### Image: <br />
- slideshow with ken burns effect (tested it, there is not enough processing power) <br />
- make a new slideshow function based on webbrowser so we could use transition effects (tested it, there is not enough processing power) <br />

### Filebrowser: <br />
- Simplified filebrowser to upload files with drag'n'drop (dropzone.js, but how to configure server?) <br />

### Autostart
- Autostart to Processing in fullscreen (still not sure how to execute command, any help from a processing pro?) <br />
- Autostart to sound analyzer (cava)  <br />

### Others:<br />
- Integrate some sort of remote management (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/access-over-Internet/) <br />
- Integrate remote webcam control  <br />
- configure a libray and button for lirc to remotely turn on/off TV's and Projectors without RJ45. <br />
- move softedge file location to another place<br />
- Add OLA DMX trigger scripts to control PVJ with DMX commands<br />
- Add OLA DMX recorder script and DMX playback script to record and playback DMX commands <br />
- Search for an DMX player, https://github.com/peterdikant/SimpleDmxEngine which could be synced to omxplayer <br />
- add a cava button br />
- screen controls for color, brightness, contrast (openframeworks solution?) <br />
- function to show CPU usage (top is loded, just need to implement in CP now)<br />
- function to display version of omxplayer, feh, tcpsyphon<br />
- if this still causes trouble:  [terminal square blink](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3268/how-to-disable-local-terminal-showing-through-when-playing-video)
- add dmx in scripts to trigger videos via dmx: https://wiki.openlighting.org/index.php/OLA_DMX_Trigger <br />



### Tutorials (Pocketvj.com/Vimeo): <br />

- New video which features the product and its functions<br />
- All autostart functions <br />
- Filename-Fixer<br />
